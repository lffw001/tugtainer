# Tugtainer is a self-hosted app for automating updates of your docker containers

<img src="resources/social_preview.jpg" width="100%">

Please be aware that the application is distributed as is and is not recommended for use in a production environment.

And don't forget about regular backups of important data.

Automatic updates are disabled by default. You can choose only what you need.

## Deploy:

- ### Quick start

  Use [docker-compose.app.yml](./docker-compose.app.yml) or following docker commands.

  ```bash
  # create volume
  docker volume create tugtainer_data

  # pull image
  docker pull quenary/tugtainer:latest

  # run container
  docker run -d -p 9412:80 \
      --name=tugtainer \
      --restart=unless-stopped \
      -v tugtainer_data:/tugtainer \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
      quenary/tugtainer:latest
  ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind that you **cannot update** an **agent** or a **socket-proxy** from within the app because they are used to communicate with the Docker CLI.
> Avoid including these containers in a docker-compose that contains other containers you want to update automatically, as this will result in an error during the update.
> To keep them updated, you can activate the "check" only to receive notifications, and recreate manually or from another tool, such as Portainer.

- ### Remote hosts

  To manage remote hosts from one UI, you have to deploy the Tugtainer Agent.
  To do so, you can use [docker-compose.agent.yml](./docker-compose.agent.yml) or following docker commands.

  After deploying the agent, in the UI follow Menu -> Hosts, and add it with the respective parameters.

  Remember that the machine with the agent must be accessible for the primary instance.

  Don't forget to change **AGENT_SECRET** variable. It is used for backend-agent requests signature.

  Backend and agent use http to communicate, so you can utilize reverse proxy for https.

  ```bash
  # pull image
  docker pull quenary/tugtainer-agent:latest

  # run container
  docker run -d -p 9413:8001 \
      --name=tugtainer-agent \
      --restart=unless-stopped \
      -e AGENT_SECRET="CHANGE_ME!" \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
      quenary/tugtainer-agent:latest
  ```

- ### Socket proxy

  You can use Tugtainer and Tugtainer Agent without direct mount of docker socket.

  [docker-compose.app.yml](./docker-compose.app.yml) and [docker-compose.agent.yml](./docker-compose.agent.yml) use this approach by default.

  Manual setup:

  - Deploy socket-proxy e.g. https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/socket-proxy
  - Enable at least **CONTAINERS, IMAGES, POST, INFO, PING** for the **check** feature, and **NETWORKS** for the **update** feature;
  - Set env var DOCKER_HOST="tcp://my-socket-proxy:port" to the Tugtainer(-agent) container(s);

## Check and update process:

- ### Groups

  Every check/update process performed by a group of containers.

  - Containers from the same **compose project** (same **com.docker.compose.project** and **com.docker.compose.project.config_files** labels) will end up in the same group.

  - Containers labeled with [dev.quenary.tugtainer.depends_on](#custom-labels) will end up in a group with listed containers.

  - Otherwise, there will be a group of one container.

- ### Scheduled:

  - For each **host defined in the UI**, the check/update process starts at time specified in the settings;
  - All containers of the host are distributed among **groups**;
  - Each container in the group receives an **action based on your selection in the UI** (check/update/none);
  - [_Actual process_](#actual-process)

- ### Click of check/update button:

  - **The container** (and **possible participants**) added to a group;
  - **The container** receives an action based on the button you've clicked (check or update);
  - **Other possible participants** receives an **action based on your selection in the UI**. For instance, if you've clicked the update button for container 'a', and container 'b' is **participant** and it is **marked for auto-update** and there is **new image** for it, **it will also be updated**. Otherwise, **participant** will not be updated even if there is a new image for it.
  - [_Actual process_](#actual-process)

- ### Actual process

  - **Image pull** performed for containers marked for **check**;
  - If there is a **new image** for any group's container and it is **marked for auto-update**, the update process begins;
    * [protected](#custom-labels) containers will be skipped
    * not `running` containers will be skipped
  - After that, all containers in the group are stopped in **order from most dependent**;
  - Then, **in reverse order** (from most dependable):
    - Updatable containers being recreated and started;
    - Non-updatable containers being started;

## Private registries

  To use private registries, you have to mount docker config to Tugtainer or Tugtainer Agent, depending on where the container with the private image is located.

  - Create the config using one of the methods on the host machine
    - Log into the registry `docker login <registry>`
    - Manually
    ```json
      {
        "auths": {
          "<registry>": {
            "auth": "base64 encoded 'username:password_or_token'"
          }
        }
      }
    ```
  - Mount the config to the Tugtainer (Agent) as a readonly volume `-v $HOME/.docker/config.json:/root/.docker/config.json:ro` or in a docker-compose file.
  - That's all you need to do, Docker CLI will take care of the rest.

## Custom labels:

- dev.quenary.tugtainer.protected=true

  This label indicates that the container cannot be stopped. This means that even if there is a new image for the container, it cannot be updated from the app. This label is primarily used for **tugtainer** itself and **tugtainer-agent**, as well as for **socket-proxy** in the provided docker-compose files.

- dev.quenary.tugtainer.depends_on="my_postgres,my_redis"

  This label is an alternative to the docker compoes label. It allows you to declare that a container depends on another container, even if they are not in the same compose project. List of container names, separated by commas.

## Notifications:

The app uses [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise?tab=readme-ov-file#productivity-based-notifications) to send notifications and [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) to generate their content. You can view the documentation for each of them for more details.

Jinja2 custom filters:

- any_worthy - checks that at least one of the items has result equal to "available", "updated", "rolled_back" or "failed"

Jinja2 context schema:

```json
{
  "hostname": "Tugtainer container hostname",
  "results": [
    {
      "host_id": 0,
      "host_name": "string",
      "items": [
        {
          "container": {
            "id": "string",
            "image": "string",
            "...other keys of 'docker container inspect' in snake_case": {},
          },
          "old_image": {
            "id": "string",
            "repo_digests": [
              "digest1",
              "digest2",
            ],
            "...other keys of 'docker image inspect' in snake_case": {},
          },
          "new_image": {
            "...same schema as for old_image": {},
          },
          "result": "not_available|available|available(notified)|updated|rolled_back|failed|None"
        }
      ],
      "prune_result": "string",
    }
  ]
}
```

"result" options:
- "not_available": No new image found.
- "available": New image available for the container.
- "available(notified)": New image available for the container, but it was in the previous notification. The app preserves digests of new images, so if another new image has appeared, the result will still be "available".
- "updated": Container successfully recreaded with the new image.
- "rolled_back": The app failed to recreate the container, but was able to restore it with the old image.
- "failed": The app failed to recreate container.

The notification is sent only if the body is not empty. For instance, if there is only containers with "available(notified)" results, the body will be empty (with default template), and notification will not be sent.

If you want to restore default template, it's [here](./backend/const.py)

## Auth

The app uses password authorization by default. The password is stored in the file in encrypted form.

Auth cookies are not domain-specific and not https only, but you can change this using env variables.

Starting with v1.6.0, you can use the OpenID Connect provider instead of password. This can also be configured using env variables.

## Env:

Environment variables are not required, but you can still define some. There is [.env.example](/.env.example) containing list of vars with description.
